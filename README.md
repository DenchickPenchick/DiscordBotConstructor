# Discord Bot
With this library you can build your bot easy. For example, you can run bot by one string of code!
```csharp
new Bot("your token here").RunBotAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
```
But you *should* install that:
[Discord](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)
[Discord Interactivity](https://github.com/foxbot/Discord.Addons.Interactive)
[DependencyInjection](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)

**The repository is under development. In future there will be interactive and some things**
